## A few words regarding the Arctic Code Vault

As of 2019-12-29 I have pulled out and removed all my repositories out of GitHub with the intent to start self-hosting them. When the repositories were created they were never meant to be archived into the Arctic, seemingly without the ability to interact with it. In other words, it's a privacy nightmare.

Now you might say that the code is already public anyway. And you're absolutely right, it is. But as with all published things, it's quite nice to have a delete button, and better yet a modify button too. The Arctic Code Vault does not offer this. In other words, once it's pushed in there, it's there to stay.

Most of my code is already quite old and bad code too. Code of my current project(s) has not been pushed into GitHub.. perhaps that's a good thing at this point. Additionally, there's no reason whatsoever for someone 1000 years later or whatever to dig up this code. What do you expect them to look for? All the bugs that made 2019 great? Would you be interested in the source code from even just 20 years ago? I certainly wouldn't, except for historical purposes perhaps. Released code, that is! Not the master and definitely not a development branch. So why?

Do I want my code to be archived? No, I really do not. Was it a good idea to just treat every public repository as "eh, it's public anyway, privacy be damned"? In my opinion, not at all. How difficult was it to ask developers to opt their repositories into this thing, on a case-by-case basis? Without the need to archive and/or pull out repositories entirely, breaking many things in the process? Big brain there Microsoft. Bless you and your ways!

As of 2020-03-18 my repositories are now hosted [here](https://ghnou.su/gitea/ghnou).
